            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Organizer</h3>
            <p id="price_limit_section">The Organizer is treated like any other participant as far as matching goes. The only difference between
                participants and the organizer is that the organizer has control over the optional price limit, and the
                format of the emails. Please keep in mind the organizer is a player too, and as such they will also be
                randomly matched with another participant.</p>
            <h3 id="email_section">Price Limit</h3>
            <p>The price limit is entirely optional. Some groups like to have a price limit so that all members spend
                roughly the same amount. If your group doesn't, simply leave the limit empty or with a '0'.</p>
            <h3>Email Template: Subject Line</h3>
            <p>The email template section allows the organizer to customize the email participants will receive. The
                subject line should let participants know why they are receiving the email, so they don't accidentally
                delete or ignore the email.</p>
            <h3>Email Template: Body</h3>
            <p>The email template section shows the organizer what the email will look like when it is received. If the
                organizer elects to set a price limit, the email will tell the participants what that price limit is.
                <b>PARTICIPANT</b> will be replaced with the name of the person receiving the email, and <b>MATCH</b>
                will be replaced by the name of the person the participant will be buying a gift for. Aside from
                setting a price limit, the email body cannot be changed by the organizer.</p>
            <h3>Participants</h3>
            <p>Please enter a valid name and email address for each participant. Press the red "Add Participant" button
                to add an additional participant. Press the red "Remove" button to remove a participant if you have
                added too many.</p>
            <h3>Import CSV File</h3>
            <p>Want to add participants more quickly? Its simple! Just upload a CSV file. To create a CSV file create a
                new text file, and on each line of the file write the participant's name, followed by a comma, and then
                their email address. Place each participant on a new line. When all participants have been entered,
                save the text document as a .csv file.</p>

            <h2>Other Questions</h2>
            <h3>Does this website save any information?</h3>
            <p>No! After all emails have successfully been sent out, all of the data you entered into the website is
                purged from our servers. You will never receive another email from us (unless you use the site again
                next year!).</p>
